### General Information
As part of the users thesis, they used Loboda's Online Reading Span Task (2012; https://ubiq-x.gitlab.io/rspan/) to investigate the impact of auditory noise on university student's performance in tasks of higher cognition. This task produces a "Results" box which can be copied into an individual text file for each condition for each participant. This results box/text file includes the order in which the number sentence-letter combinations were presented to participants, as well as letters presented, letters recalled, whether a participant was correct or incorrect in their letter recall and whether a participant was correct or incorrect in their sentence classification. Participants also receive a total number of presented combinations, a total sentence comprehension accuracy score and four working memory capacity scores, all calculated in different ways. However, participants were required to complete this experiment in a number of different conditions resulting in many text files that are difficult to examine as a whole. Thus this Matlab project was created to extract and organise information for initial examination before data analysis using IBM SPSS. This project was created using Matlab 24.2.
